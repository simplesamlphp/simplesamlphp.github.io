**Information disclosure of source code**

### Background

The module controller in `SimpleSAML\Module` that processes requests for pages
hosted by modules, has code to identify paths ending with `.php` and process
those as PHP code. If no other suitable way of handling the given path exists it
presents the file to the browser.

### Description

The check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not account for uppercase
letters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server is
serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the
processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead
presented to the browser.

### Affected versions

SimpleSAMLphp versions **1.18.5 and older**.

### Impact

An attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in third-party
modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive. However, the attack
surface is considered small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp
serves such content from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on
Windows.

### Resolution

Upgrade the SimpleSAMLphp installation to version **1.18.6**.

### Credit

This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Sławek Naczyński.
