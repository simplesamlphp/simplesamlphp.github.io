**Link injection**

### Background

Several scripts part of SimpleSAMLphp display a web page with links obtained from the request parameters.
This allows us to enhance usability, as the users are presented with links they can follow after completing a certain
action, like logging out.

### Description

The following scripts were not checking the URLs obtained via the HTTP request before displaying them as the target of
links that the user may click on:

* `www/logout.php`
* `modules/core/www/no_cookie.php`

The issue allowed attackers to display links targeting a malicious website inside a trusted site running SimpleSAMLphp,
due to the lack of security checks involving the `link_href` and `retryURL` HTTP parameters, respectively.
The issue was resolved by including a verification of the URLs received in the request against a white list of
websites specified in the `trusted.url.domains` configuration option.

### Affected versions

All SimpleSAMLphp versions prior to **1.14.4**.

### Impact

A remote attacker could craft a link pointing to a trusted website running SimpleSAMLphp, including a parameter pointing
to a malicious website, and try to fool the victim into visiting that website by clicking on a link in the page
presented by SimpleSAMLphp.

### Resolution

Upgrade to the [latest version](/download).
