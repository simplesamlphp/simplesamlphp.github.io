<p><strong>Information disclosure of source code</strong></p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>The module controller in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SimpleSAML\Module</code> that processes requests for pages
hosted by modules, has code to identify paths ending with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.php</code> and process
those as PHP code. If no other suitable way of handling the given path exists it
presents the file to the browser.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>The check to identify paths ending with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.php</code> does not account for uppercase
letters. If someone requests a path ending with e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.PHP</code> and the server is
serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the
processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead
presented to the browser.</p>

<h3 id="affected-versions">Affected versions</h3>

<p>SimpleSAMLphp versions <strong>1.18.5 and older</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>

<p>An attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in third-party
modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive. However, the attack
surface is considered small, as the attack will only work when SimpleSAMLphp
serves such content from a file system that is not case-sensitive, such as on
Windows.</p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>

<p>Upgrade the SimpleSAMLphp installation to version <strong>1.18.6</strong>.</p>
