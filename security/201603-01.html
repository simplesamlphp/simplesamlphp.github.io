<p><strong>Information leakage issue in the <em>sanitycheck</em> module</strong></p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>The <em>sanitycheck</em> module, enabled by default, displays different kinds of information about a SimpleSAMLphp
installation, aiming to help administrators to determine the correct behaviour of the software, as well as obtain
valuable information that can be used to resolve problems. It can also be used by automated processes to determine the
overall status of the software.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Information_Leakage">information leakage issue</a> has been identified and corrected
in the <em>sanitycheck</em> module. The issue allows attackers to obtain information about the exact version of PHP run by the
affected system.</p>
