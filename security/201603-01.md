**Information leakage issue in the *sanitycheck* module**.

### Background

The *sanitycheck* module, enabled by default, displays different kinds of information about a SimpleSAMLphp
installation, aiming to help administrators to determine the correct behaviour of the software, as well as obtain
valuable information that can be used to resolve problems. It can also be used by automated processes to determine the
overall status of the software.

### Description

An [information leakage issue](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Information_Leakage) has been identified and corrected
in the *sanitycheck* module. The issue allows attackers to obtain information about the exact version of PHP run by the
affected system.

### Affected versions

All SimpleSAMLphp versions prior to **1.14.1**.

### Impact

A remote attacker could learn information about the exact PHP version run by the affected system, allowing the search
for vulnerabilities known to work with that version.

### Resolution

Upgrade to the [latest version](/download).

### Credit

This security issue was discovered and reported by Enrique de la Hoz.
