    <h1 id="contribute">Contribute</h1>

<p>The SimpleSAMLphp project benefits from a global community of software developers who contribute to it.
The project receives financial support from higher education, research and corporate entities. The
legal, administrative home of SimpleSAMLphp is <em>The Commons Conservancy</em> foundation based in The Netherlands, where it
is established as a programme.</p>

<p>The project, however, needs more contributors in order to survive, and we therefore kindly ask you to consider
supporting it. For many, this software comprises a vital piece of AAI infrastructure that merits proper maintenance,
care and attention. Sustaining SimpleSAMLphp will help you to continue to use this software in a secure and trusted way,
and would help getting new features and capabilities in the future that could benefit your organisation. While the
project has an important need for financial contributions, we of course also very much welcome structural, in-kind
ones, that could help sustain it.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions or have the ability to contribute either financially or with your work, please do not
hesitate to contact Jan Meijer at jan.meijer@sikt.no. Any help is welcome, and it can be as simple as <a href="/lists">translating
SimpleSAMLphp into your language</a>!</p>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>

<p>We would like to thank the organisations that have contributed financially to the survival of the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sikt.no/">Sikt</a> (formerly Uninett)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.cirrusidentity.com/">Cirrus Identity</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The project wouldn’t be possible either without the in-kind contributions of the many developers who have worked on it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tim van Dijen, main developer</li>
  <li>Thijs Kinkhorst, SURF</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve had many contributors through the years. Here are some of them that we would like to thank particularly for the
importance of their past work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Andreas Åkre Solberg, Sikt, project founder</li>
  <li>Olav Morken, Sikt, former main developer and maintainer</li>
  <li>Jaime Pérez Crespo, former main developer and maintainer</li>
</ul>

<p>Many others have helped make this project possible. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/simplesamlphp/simplesamlphp/graphs/contributors">list of
contributors</a> for a more comprehensive list of
people who have contributed to it one way or another. Thanks a lot to all of you!</p>

<h2 id="board">Board</h2>

<p>The project also established in the recent years a Board of Directors that works on taking care of all the
administrative stuff around it, trying to guarantee its continuity. The Board is currently comprised of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jan Meijer, chair, Sikt</li>
  <li>Dedra Chamberlin, Cirrus Identity</li>
  <li>Niels van Dijk, SURF</li>
  <li>Jaime Pérez Crespo, Disruptive Technologies</li>
  <li>Marina Adomeit, SUNET</li>
</ul>
